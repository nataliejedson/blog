Pinegrove 

Every once in a while I come across a band and think "My parents might actually enjoy this." I miss connecting over music in that way. I want it deeply. 

It's like a cross between the ben harper vibes I was always surrounded by and some of my current faves, like pile and radiator hospita l

I actually put this on for the first time while I was at work and I had to turn it off because I was starting to cry. (Music makes me cry fairly often, don't worry about it.)
