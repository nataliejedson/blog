Git is great. We all know this. Can you imagine building an app without version control? Terrifying. 

With that said, there are a few things I've learned along the way that have helped me IMMENSELY during my "oh crap" moments.

As a developer, I spend a lot of time googling things, including questions about git commands. When I first started using git in a professional setting, it seemed like I would always end up looking at the [Official Git Documentation](GHKDFS INSERT LINK HERE). But listen to this: all of that information is available via the command line, even when you're offline. Right now I'm in a coffee shop and the power is out, but I'm still able to look up the documentation  relevant to this article. Pretty cool!

### Recovering a file that you have accidentally deleted

### Amending a commit message 

### Removing things from the working tree 

### Git diffing
