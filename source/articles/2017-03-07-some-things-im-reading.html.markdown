Lately, I've been trying to ease away from watching Netflix in the evenings. This means that I've been doing a lot more reading and listening to music, which I really enjoy. Last week was a particularly good week for me in terms of putting stuff into my brain. Here are a few things I've been taking in: 

##### *The Neon Vernacular*, Yusef Komunyakaa 

I picked this up the other day after one of my favorite Twitter accounts, [Astro Poets](http://www.twitter.com/poetastrologers), posted a quote from one of Komunyakaa's poems. 


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I said I wouldn&#39;t  <br>dammit: No tears.   <br>I&#39;m stone. I&#39;m flesh.   <br><br>-Yusef Komunyakaa, Taurus</p>&mdash; Astro Poets (@poetastrologers) <a href="https://twitter.com/poetastrologers/status/829856222778105856">February 10, 2017</a></blockquote>

I had read his great poem, [Ode to the Maggot](https://www.ibiblio.org/ipa/poems/komunyakaa/ode_to_the_maggot.php) for a seminar in college and thought that it would be good to revisit his work as a sort of counterbalance to the Collected Poems of James Merrill, which I have been wading through for a while. 

I decided to pick up *The Neon Vernacular* because it won the Pulitzer Prize—-that is, I decided sort of arbitrarily. I'm only about 50 pages in, but I haven't been disappointed. He has a unique way of using the line to maintain momentum in a poem, and his approach to writing about childhood and heritage—-both familial and cultural--is admirable.


##### *Run the Jewels 3*, Run the Jewels


![ALBUM COVER](http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/rtj3__COVER.jpg)

This album is just great. I gave it a cursory listen when it came out, but last week I rediscovered it after my boyfriend brought up how good it was. This album is flawless. I think I've listened to it six times in the past seven days. Worth checking out. 

##### *[George Saunders: what writers really do when they write](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/04/what-writers-really-do-when-they-write)*

Sometimes I doubt the efficacy of reading writers on writing. It can be educational, but I often turn to it when I'm avoiding reading or writing poetry itself. It's circularity has a way of making me feel productive when I'm not.

That being said, I really I like reading George Saunders on writing. His work has a freedom that I really aspire to, and it's just generally comforting to read about other people's revision processes. I read a long piece of his on Writing and Education a while ago in an [n+1](https://nplusonemag.com/) anthology called MFA v. NYC, which basically said "Writing is really easy to overthink——you should be wary of that impulse." (You can read that piece *[here.](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/my-writing-education-a-timeline)*) I'm generally a fan of things and people that remind me to chill out because I'm constantly forgetting to relax. These two articles fall into that category. 

##### *Trojan Poetry 21: "Bats" by Henri Cole*

Henri Cole [tweeted](https://twitter.com/ColeHenri/status/839252767143149568) about this today. I'm already a huge fan of his twitter. He posts [great pictures](https://twitter.com/ColeHenri/status/830085843456962560) with funny captions. 

Anyway, this video is great and is representative of a lot of things I've been leaning into lately. Mostly being cheesy and unashamed of it. I tend to find mundane things really funny, which is also part of the appeal.
