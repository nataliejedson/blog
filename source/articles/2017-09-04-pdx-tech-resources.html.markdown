Lately, I've been navigating the rocky waters of trying to find a job as a Junior Developer. I have less than a year's worth of experience in the field, and I'm self taught with very little in the way of a portfolio. (I'm working on that last one!) This means that on paper, I'm a bit of a risk; my work ethic and intelligence don't shine through in the few lines I devote to them in my resume. 

To counter this phenomenon, I have a three-pronged strategy—I'm putting content out online, networking in real life, and applying for jobs as much as I can. This blog, in addition to a few side projects I have in the works, is the crux of my effort to expand my online presence. In order to successfully work at the other two aspects of my plan, it helps to know where to look for the relevant information. I'm focusing heavily on the Portland job market, so I've aggregated a list of resources to help my friends who are also looking for Junior Developer Jobs in the area. Here it is! 

#### JOB BOARDS 
<br>
###### [Silicon Florist Jobs](https://jobs.siliconflorist.com/)
 
[Silicon Florist](https://www.siliconflorist.com) is a great blog that highlights important events and trends in the Portland Startup scene. The guy who writes the blog, [Rick Turoczy](https://twitter.com/turoczy) is super passionate about Portland Tech, and it shows. On the website's job board, you can both look at listings and set up a profile to get your name out there. You can also sign up to get alerts for listings that contain your specified keywords, which helps you stay on top of new opportunities. 

###### [PDX Women in Tech](https://www.pdxwit.org/jobs)

I went to an Intro to Machine Learning workshop that PDXWIT organized a few weeks ago, and I loved it! What struck me most about the event was how well executed it was, and how clear they seemed to be about their mission—they really want to help women enter and stay in Tech. With that in mind, they have a job board on their website. I find it really easy to navigate, plus I love that the companies who advertise there make a point of supporting a Women in Tech group. 


#### EVENTS 
<br>
###### [Calagator](https://calagator.org)

This website is great because it's basically just a chronological list of all of the tech events in Portland. It's pretty bare bones, but if you have a free night you can just pop on and see if anything is happening. I think that a lot of the struggle of networking is just getting yourself out of the house at the end of a workday. Calagator makes tech event listings seem less intimidating and more like movie listings; you can spontaneously decide to go to something outside of your comfort zone and not have to think too hard about what and where it'll be. 

###### [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com)

Ah, the old classic. Meetup.com is of course not Portland specific, but I really like using meetup because it's easy to filter for specific interests; when I look at the list of upcoming events, I know that it'll all pretty much be stuff that I'm interested in. It's great if you're the type of person who likes to plan their weeks out ahead of time.

I'll add to this list as I find new sources of information! Happy searching!
